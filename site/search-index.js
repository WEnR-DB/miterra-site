(2019), and an updated version with a new parameter set was presented by Hafner et al. (2025). Miterra follows the 2025 version of the ALFAM2 model. Figure 16.1: Schematic diagram of the ALFAM2 model showing flow directions and associated primary parameters that determine the flow dynamics. The flow dynamics in ALFAM2 model is determined by 6 primary parameters: Parameter Description Partition fraction of applied TAN to fast pool. The rest 1 - f0 goes to the slow pool. First-order rate constant for NH3-N emissions from the fast pool. First-order rate constant for transfer from the fast pool to the slow pool. First-order rate constant for NH3-N emissions from the slow pool. Fraction of the fast pool that remains following slurry incorporation, while 1 - f4 is transferred to the slow pool. First-order rate constant for loss from the slow pool to a sink that no longer makes contribution to emission. Climate data Hourly precipitation (mm h–1). Hourly air temperature (°C). Hourly wind speed at 2 m from surface (m s–1). Management data Slurry application method: broadcast, trailing shoe/hose, open slot injection, or closed slot injection. Slurry incorporation method: no incorporation, shallow incorporation, or deep incorporation. Time of slurry incorporation after application (h). Slurry type: is it a pig slurry or not. A simulation by ALFAM2 should include at least 2 time points: the time when slurry is applied to the soil (tapp), and the time when the cumulative emissions are counted (tend, end of simulation). If the slurry is incorporated into soil, a third point tinc at the time of incorporation should be added (tapp < tinc < tend). If the dynamics of NH3 emissions is of interest, any number of additional time points may be added between tapp and tend to estimate the instantaneous NH3 emissions at particular time points after slurry application. The value of each primary parameter (p) is determined by a set of predictor variables and associated secondary parameters, and transformed with a logistic (for f parameters) or antilog function (for r parameters): Equation 16.1 where: is a standard value of 1 h–1 for all r parameters or 1 (dimensionless) for all f parameters, which is included for unit consistency. is a transformation function for the specific primary parameter. is the second parameter corresponding to χi. is the i-th predictor variable associated with the primary parameter. The values of all numeric predictor variables are first transformed by centering (subtracting the center means from their original values). The center means are given below: Predictor Variable Center Mean Slurry dry matter (%) 6.0 Slurry pH 7.5 Air temperature (°C) 13.0 The table below lists all available predictor variables and associated secondary parameters for each primary parameter: A predictor should be removed from the list if there is no data available for it. For example, if slurry pH is unknown, then it should not be included in the equation to determine the values of primary parameters r1 and r3.

The value of f4 is determined for each time point in the simulation. The value is set to 1 when there is no incorporation, or before incorporation takes place. At the time of and after incorporation, the value of f4 is calculated using Equation 16.1. At the beginning of the simulation, applied slurry TAN is partitioned into a fast-emitting pool (F) and a slow-emitting pool (S). Equation 16.2 For any given time interval Δt, let subscript t0 denotes the start point of the interval, subscript t denotes the end point of the interval, and subscript t–1 denotes the end point of the previous time interval. Then, the initial sizes of the F and S pools at the beginning of the interval are determined as follows: Equation 16.3 The sizes of the F and S pools at the end of interval Δt are: Equation 16.4 where: As a safety check, ϑ should not exceed 1E200. The NH3 emissions from the F and S pools during interval Δt are: Equation 16.5 Cumulative emission from both pools by the end of the interval may be calculated as: Equation 16.6 In Miterra, ALFAM2 is used to estimate NH3 emissions from two sources: field application of liquid slurry, and deposition of liquid slurry (urine) during grazing. For field application of liquid slurry, the slurry TAN content is calculated in 10. N Losses from Soil. For liquid slurry deposition during grazing, the TAN content is calculated in 10. N Losses from Soil. It is assumed that the total TAN is spread over the grazing months evenly. The grazing months are months with an average temperature over 10°C. Monthly total precipitation is converted to hourly precipitation by dividing 30 (days) × 24 (hours) × rainfall intensity (i.e., fraction of a day with rainfall; default to 0.4). Monthly average temperature is used as hourly temperature. Wind speed at 10 m from surface is converted to wind speed at 2 m using the following equation: Equation 16.7 where: is the wind speed measured at 10 m from surface (m s–1); and is a surface roughness parameter, which equals 1/10th of the crop height when height is available, otherwise, it is set to 0.01 (m). Miterra uses “Utilised agricultural area fertilised by manure application technique, farm type and NUTS 2 region” from Eurostat to derive the area fractions of each manure application method. Eurostat application techniques are mapped to application methods defined in ALFAM2. Incorporation methods (harrowing, ploughing, etc.) and incorporation time are not specified in Eurostat data, but are important in ALFAM2. Therefore, any application technique with incorporation are further broken down to shallow and deep incorporation in ALFAM2. Incorporation time is assumed to be 4 hours after application, except for technique “manure broadcast incorporation after 4 hours”, where incorporation time is assumed to be 24 hours after application. Table 16.1: Mapping of Eurostat application techniques to ALFAM2 application and incorporation methods. Eurostat Application Technique ALFAM2 Application Method ALFAM2 Incorporation Method Incorporation Time Manure broadcast no incorporation Broadcast No incorporation N.A.

Manure injection deep/closed slit Closed slot injection No incorporation N.A. Additionally, the following assumptions are made: For grassland and winter wheat/barley, slurry is not incorporated, as incorporation techniques would destroy these crops. For application methods that are further broken down to shallow and deep incorporation, it is assumed that shallow incorporation accounts for XX% of the area, and deep incorporation XX%. This is a rough estimation based on the fraction of occurrences of each incorporation method in the ALFAM2 database.","title":"16.

The BC accumulation is simply calculated as the difference of input minus output: Equation 14.2 where: is the total external input by fertilizer, manure, and deposition (not including weathering). is the total uptake by plants. is the losses via runoff from soil. is the losses via leaching from soil. All flux terms are given in mole ha–1 yr–1. To convert between kg ha–1 yr–1 and mol charge ha–1 yr–1: where: is the molar mass per charge of the cation (g mol–1), being 20 for Ca2+ (40/2), 12 for Mg2+ (24/2), 39 for K+ and 23 for Na+. Soil acidification due to the release of base cations (BC, defined as the sum of Ca2+, Mg2+ K+, and Na+) occurs when the sum of leaching and uptake exceeds the external input by fertilizer, manure, and deposition. This is generally the case since the loss of nitrate from the soil is accompanied by base cations. The input of BCs by fertilizer and manure is determined by their application rates and composition, while the BC removal by crop harvesting is determined by crop yields and BC concentrations in crop products. Equation 14.3 where: is the annual application rate of the input material (kg N or total weight ha–1 yr–1), be it a fertiliser, manure, or deposition. is the fraction of a BC in the input material, relative to the N content or total weight. is the annual yield of the crop (kg dry or fresh weight ha–1 yr–1). is the fraction of a BC in the harvested crop product, relative to the dry or fresh weight. See TIP in Equation 14.2 for unit conversion. BC loss by leaching and runoff is calculated by multiplying the water flux in a given layer with BC concentrations. Equation 14.4 where: is the concentration of respective BC charge in soil solution (mole L–1). is the annual interflow (surface runoff) (m3 ha–1 yr–1). is the annual leaching effluent to groundwater (m3 ha–1 yr–1). These concentrations are calculated by assuming charge balance, i.e., the sum of cation charge is equal to the sum of anion charge. The cations include Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ (assuming that other cations, such as ammonium, aluminium, and iron, are negligible), and anions consist of SO42–, NO3–, Cl– and HCO3– (assuming that other anions, such as phosphate and organic anions, are negligible): Equation 14.5 The subscript e denotes that these concentrations are expressed as concentrations of electric charges. All terms are given in mole L–1. The fractions of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ charges in total BC charge concentration are set to fixed values based on soil calcareousity. Table 14.1: Fractions of cation in total base cations. Non-calcareous soil 0.7 0.2 0.1 0 Calcareous soil 1.0 0 0 0 Fractions are given as the electric charge concentration of respective cation relative to the total BC charge concentration. Below we give the calculation of the charge concentrations of anions: The calculation of SO42– and NO3– concentrations is given in S runoff & leaching and N leaching, respectively. The SO42– concnetration (mol L–1) must be multiplied by 2 to give the charge concentration of SO42– (mole L–1). The Cl– concentration in leaching/runoff is calculated by assuming no interaction with the soil (tracer behaviour), i.e., the output is equal to the input minus crop removal without accumulation. The HCO3– concentration is calculated based on the calcareousity (How do we determine which soil is calcareous? CaCO3 > 15%?) of the soil, according to De Vries and Breeuwsma (1986): In non-calcareous soils, the HCO3– concentration is calculated by assuming equilibrium with the soil CO2 pressure and soil pH. In calcareous soils, the HCO3– concentration is calculated by assuming equilibrium with the CO2 pressure in the soil only. Equation 14.6 Note For non-calcareous soils, the original equation is given as: where: is the soil CO2 pressure (bar), which is set to 0.02 bar (20 mbar). is the soil pH determined in water (soil solution). In calcareous soils, base saturation is set to 100%, and the change in base saturation is assumed negligible since the acid production rate is fully counteracted by the dissolution of CaCO3. The initial pH is assumed to stay constant. The change in BCexchangeable is thus proportioned over Ca, Mg, K and Naexchangeable with the initial fractions on the adsorption complex being derived from data and assumed to stay equal over time. A first approximation of weathering rates can be determined by a combination of soil texture class (determined by clay and sand content), and parent material (classified into acidic, intermediate, basic, or organic based on soil type), as given below (De Vries et al., 1994a; UNECE Mapping Manual, 2004). Table 14.2: Relationships between BC weathering rates (mole ha–1 m–1 yr–1) and combinations of parent material class and texture class. Parent material class Texture class Coarse Coarse/Medium Coarse/Fine Medium Medium/Fine Fine Acidic 250 750 1250 1750 Intermediate 750 1250 1750 1750 2250 2750 Basic 750 1250 2250 2750 Determination of texture classes Texture class Clay content (%) Coarse ≤ 18 Medium (18, 35] Fine > 35 Two texture classes may occur within the same mapping unit.

The weathering rates derived from Table 14.2 must be further corrected for the effect of temperature according to (Sverdrup, 1990; De Vries et al., 1994a): Equation 14.7 where is the corrected weathering rate (mole ha–1 m–1 yr–1) at a local mean annual temperature (K); is the average weathering rate defined in Table 14.2 at a reference temperature (K) (De Vries et al., 1994a); Texture class Coarse Coarse/Medium Coarse/Fine Medium Medium/Fine Fine T0 (in °C) 4.3 2.6 6.5 8.3 8.5 8.8 is a pre-exponential temperature factor (K), with a default value of 3600 K (Sverdrup, 1990). With the change in exchangeable BC ( ), the change in base saturation ( ) can be derived: Equation 14.8 where: is the change in exchangeable BC (mole ha–1 yr–1). is cation exchange capacity (mmole kg–1). is bulk density of the soil (g cm–3). is soil thickness (cm). The base saturation (BS) is then calculated as the initial BS plus the change: Equation 14.9 The initial BS ( ) can be derived from Equation 14.10 for non-calcareous soils. For calcareous soils, is set to 100%. The BS calculated above can be larger than 100%, which indicate the extra \"buffer\" BC pool. For calcareous soils, we assume soil pH remained unchanged during the entire period. For non-calcareous soils, we assume a linear relationship between pH 4.5 and pH 6.5 with a base saturation varying from 20-100%, according to: Equation 14.10 When the calculated pH < 4.5: pH = 4.5, and BS = 20%. When the calculated pH > 6.5: pH = 6.5, and BS remains unchanged. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) can be determined as: Equation 14.11 where: is the fraction of clay in the soil (%). is the fraction of soil organic carbon in the soil (%). is the soil pH determined in water (soil solution).","title":"14.

In Miterra, fresh yields are used for most crops except for grass (which uses dry matter yields), and then dry matter (DM) yields are simply calculated using a DM fraction for each type of crop. N content in harvested products (Nharvest) is calculated using an N:DM ratio. Equation 6.1 where: is the fresh weight yield of the harvested crop product (kg fresh weight ha–1). is the average fraction of dry matter weight in the product (kg DM kg–1 fresh weight). is the fraction of total N in harvested dry matter (kg N kg–1 DM). For other nutrient elements (P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl & S), the content in harvested products is calculated in the same way as N: Equation 6.2 where: is the fraction of element x in harvested dry matter (kg X kg–1 DM). For heavy metal elements (Cd, Cu, Pb & Zn), their content are calculated based on bioconcentration factors (BCF): Equation 6.3 where: is the content of element X in the soil (kg X ha–1). is the BCF of element x. The areas of crops growing in the winter are determined for each crop type: For winter wheat & winter barley, they are explicitly known as winter crops and their areas are available from input. For soft wheat, durum wheat, barley, and rye, they can be grown either in spring or winter, and their areas of winter growth is determiend with a “winter share” fraction (fw). Based on that we can estimate the areas of non-winter (spring) growth for each crop: Equation 6.4 For each crop i in the region: where: is the area of crop i growing in the spring (ha). is the total area of the crop i (ha). is the fraction of crop i that is growing in the winter. Data are available from SoilCare (Eurostat/Corine). The area of cover crop growing after each crop is then estimated as: Equation 6.5 For each crop i in the region: where: is the area of cover crop growing after crop i. is the total area of cover crops in the region. Data are available from Eurostat. The fraction of cover crop after each crop (fcc) is calculated as: Equation 6.6 For each crop i in the region: where: is the area of crop i. The N uptake by cover crops is based on data from Schroder et al., who provided estimates per environmental zone on the N yield of cover crops based on temperature sum values. However, especially for Mediterranean climates these values seem high and there might be limitation by water and nitrogen. Therefore, the N uptake by catch crops is maximised at 75% of the soil N surplus, and a minimum value of 5 kg N ha–1 is applied as well. Previously a default value of 42 kg N ha–1 was used based on an average C input of 1500 kg ha–1 and a C:N ratio of 35, which is probably too high for most regions. Equation 6.7 For each crop i in the region: where: is the N uptake by the cover crop following crop i, specific to the environmental zones.

Nsurplus is derived by running the model for initialization assuming no cover crops, and using the output on soil N surplus as input for future runs. The C content in cover crops is determined by assuming a C:N ratio of 25. Equation 6.8 For each crop i in the region: For annual crops, part of the unharvested residue biomass may be further removed from the field (e.g., straw), and the rest may be incorporated into soil by tillage. The biomass of unharvested residues, removed residues, and residues incorporated into soil, are calculated using different approaches for annual crops, straw crops, and perennial crops. In all calculations in this section, the fraction of C content in crop organic matter (fC) is assumed to be 0.45 for all crop types. Most arable crops, except for straw crops (see below), are considered annual crops. The unharvested residues are calculated based on crop yields and harvest index. Residue removal and incorporation for grasslands are calculated in the same way as annual crops. Equation 6.9 where: is the harvest index, which is the ratio of harvested biomass to the annual net primary production. is the ratio of N in harvested products to N in residues. The amount of residues removed from field is determined by a country- and crop-specific removal factor. Equation 6.10 where: is the fraction of crop residues removed from field. Straw crops include cereal crops, maize, rice, sunflower, and rapeseed. Carbon inputs to soil from straw crops consist of aboveground (Cabove) and belowground residues (Cbelow). The aboveground residue biomass (Mabove) is calculated according to Scarlat et al. (2010): Equation 6.11 where: is the fresh weight yield of the harvested crop product (kg ha–1). are crop-dependent regression parameters.

A fraction of the straw is removed, and the remaining part is incorporated into soil along with the stubble. The total C incorporation from aboveground residues is thus calculated as: Equation 6.12 where: is the removal fraction of straw. is the fraction of dry matter in the stubble and straw. Crop DM fraction Wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley 0.85 Maize 0.70 Rice 0.75 Sunflower 0.60 Rapeseed 0.60 The belowground residue C is always considered as incorporated, and is calculated according to Taghizadeh-Toosi et al. (2014): Equation 6.13 where: is the fresh weight yield of the harvested crop product (kg ha–1). is the fraction of dry matter in the product. is the biomass of aboveground residues (kg ha–1). is the fraction of dry matter in the stubble and straw. is the ratio of root biomass and exudate C (below-ground C) of total net C assimilation, with a default value of 0.25. The amount of N in residues removed and incorporated into soil for straw crops is calculated as: Equation 6.14 where: is the fraction of N in stubble and straw dry matter. This section still needs to be checked. Perennial crops include fruit trees, olive trees, and grapes. Residue inputs from these crops consist of pruned leaves, dead leaves, fruit losses during growth and harvest, dead roots, root exudates, and input from grass cover. Pruned residues Yields for pruned branches and leaves are available for rainfed and irrigated fields. Part of the pruned biomass is removed, and the rest incorporated. Equation 6.15 where: is the pruning potential for irrigated land (kg DM ha–1 yr–1). is the pruning potential for rainfed land (kg DM ha–1 yr–1). is the fraction of area under irrigation. is the fraction of pruned biomass that is removed from field. is the C:N ratio of prunnings, with a default value of 60. Leaf litters Include input from dead leaves. Equation 6.16 where: is the dry matter yield of the harvested crop product (kg ha–1. Equation 6.1). is the ratio of leaf to fruit biomass. is the C:N ratio of leaf litters, with a default value of 30. Dead fruits Include input from fruit losses during growth and harvest. Equation 6.17 where: is the fraction of yield biomass lost during growth. is the fraction of yield biomass lost during harvest. is the fraction of total N in harvested fruit dry matter (kg N kg–1 DM). Belowground residues Include dead roots and root exudates. Equation 6.18 where: is the ratio of rhizodeposition to fruit biomass. It is assumed that the fine root biomass is the same as root exudates, therefore the left term is multiplied by 2 to give total belowground C input. is the C:N ratio of roots and root exudates, with a default value of 30. Total C input to soil Equation 6.19 Total N input to soil Equation 6.20 Additional residues from soil cover The grounds of some orchards are covered by grass, which contribute additionally to soil C and N input: Equation 6.21 where: is the dry matter yields of permanent grassland in the region (kg DM ha–1). it is assumed that grass cover yield is half of the yield of normal grassland. is the fraction of area covered by grass in the orchard. is the C:N ratio in grass residues with a default value of 20. In case cover crops are grown, more crop residues will be available. It is assumed that all cover crops are incorporated into soil. For fallow and set-aside lands, which are not cultivated but may have growth of weeds, it is assumed that 250 and 500 kg C ha–1, respectively, are incorporated into soil annually. The C:N ratio of the incorporated residues is assumed to be 30. Removal and incorporation of other elements (P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, S, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) is only calculated for straw crops. The amount removed/incorporated is based on the N removed/incorporated and N:X ratios. Equation 6.22 where: is the content of element X in removed/incorporated residues (kg X ha–1). is the N content in removed/incorporated residues (kg N ha–1). is the N:X ratio of the residue. Crop N uptake is simply calculated as the total N content in both harvested products and unharvested biomass. Equation 6.23 Crop demand refers to the rate of N fertilization required to satisfy crop uptake. Since not all N in the soil may become available to crops, a higher rate of N than crop uptake must be applied. This is determined by an uptake efficiency factor. Equation 6.24 where: is the crop uptake efficiency factor.

Animal excretions during grazing are distributed to permanent grasslands, temporary grasslands and rough grazings (natural grasslands). It is assumed that all permanent grasslands are used for grazing, half of the temporal grasslands are used for grazing (because they are often used for mowing/silage), and the grazing intensity on natural grasslands is 50% lower than on permanent grasslands (equivalent to half of the natural grasslands are grazed).

In the following equations in this section, the following indexes are used: denotes the NUTS region in a country; denotes the type of crop, e.g., wheat, maize, grassland, etc.; and denotes the type of manure, e.g., solid cattle manure, pig slurry, etc. The maximum manure N allowed (Nmax), and the provisionally applied manure N (Napp) are calculated for each crop in each region of the country: Equation 7.2 where: is the maximum manure N rate (kg N ha–1) allowed for crop j in region i by EU Nitrates Directive or local derogation. is the N application rate (kg N ha–1) of manure type k for crop j in region i, as estimated in Distribution of animal manure. is the area of crop j in region i (ha). To disaggregate Napp[i, j] among each manure type later, λ[i, k] is the ratio of N in manure type k to the total manure N applied in region i. Equation 7.3 The manure N surplus and gap is determined for each crop in each region: Equation 7.4 If : Else: The manure N surplus is calculated for the country: Equation 7.5 4.1: If Nsurplus, country = 0: There is no surplus in the country (i.e., every crop in every rgion received no more manure N than what’s permitted by regulation). No derogation or redistribution is available in this case. 4.2: If Nsurplus, country > 0: There is a surplus in the country, which may be redistributed to crops with a gap in the country. We consider 2 scenarios: 4.2.1: If Nsurplus, country ≥ Ngap, country: There is enough surplus in the country to cover the gap in all regions of all crops. Equation 7.6 4.2.2: If Nsurplus_country < Ngap_country: There is a surplus in the country, but it is not sufficient to cover all the gaps. A proportion of the country surplus is redistributed, which is equal to the relative size of the regional deficit to the country deficit. Equation 7.7 If : Else: NOTE: Since Nsurplus, country < Ngap, country, the right-hand side will never exceed Nmax. Disaggregate Napp[i, j] among each manure type: Equation 7.8 The amount of manure N transported out of the country is calculated by comparing the total amount applied before and after derogtion/re-distribution. Any manure that is not field applied is assumed to be exported. No destination for manure export is assumed: manures are not tracked by the Miterra model once they are transported out of the country border. Equation 7.9 where: is the total amount of manure N applied (kg N) for crop j in region i before derogation/re-distribution. is the total amount of manure N applied (kg N) for crop j in region i after derogation/re-distribution. The plant available N (Navail) is calculated from applied manure, grazing excretion, deposition and crop residues. This value is then be substracted from the crop N demand to give a more realistic mineral fertilizer application per crop. The plant available N is calculated in two parts: Navail, mineral for mineral N sources, and Navail, organic for N mineralized from crop residues, and organic fractions of manure & grazing excretions. The total Navail is the sum of the two parts. Equation 7.10 where: is the total mineral N from applied manure (kg N ha–1. See Distribution of animal manure). If mineral N fraction is unknown, the default value is assumed to be 0.75 for solid manure, and 0.4 for liquid slurry. is the total mineral N from grazing excretions (kg N ha–1. See Distribution of grazing excretions). If mineral N fraction is unknown, the default value is assumed to be 0.5. is the total N from compost (kg N ha–1.

N Source ρ Remarks Applied manure Nemissions, manure/grazing is the combined emissions of NH3, N2O & NOx from manure application or grazing excretions ( 10. N Losses from Soil).

Finally, the total plant available N is determined by combining the two parts above: Equation 7.12 First, the requirement of mineral N fertilisers by each crop (Nreq) is determined from crop N demand and N already available to the crop from other sources. To obtain a more equal fertiliser distribution among crops, we assume that at least 30% of the N demand will come from mineral fertiliser. Equation 7.13 where: is the N demand by the crop (kg N–1 ha. See Equation 6.24). is the soil available N to the crop (kg N–1 ha). The mineral N fertilizers are distributed over crops using weighing factors, so that crop with highest N demand receives the highest amount of N fertilizers. The weighing factors are calculated from the crop N uptake and the total area of the crop. Equation 7.14 For crop i in the region: where: is the weighing factor for the crop. is the total area of the crop in the region (ha). is the collection of all crops grown in that region, i ∈ n. is the application rate of mineral N fertilisers for the crop (kg N ha–1). is the sum of the amount of all types of mineral N fertiliser applied in the region (kg N).","title":"7.

The model was originally developed as a regional model, named Miterra-Europe, to assess the effects and interactions of policies and measures in agriculture on N losses on a NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) 2 level for all member states of the European Union (EU) ( Velthof et al., 2009; de Vries et al., 2011, Velthof et al., 2014). In recent projects, Miterra-Farm, a farm-level version of the Miterra model, was adapted using the same approaches of the European version, to estimate emissions and assess mitigation measures at farm scale ( Duan et al., 2022). In general, the Miterra model can estimate: Atmospheric emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and methane (CH4) from manure management and fertilization; Surface runoff and leaching of N & P to the ground- and surface waters; Turnover and sequestration of soil organic C and N; Balance of other nutrient elements: S, K, Na, Ca & Mg; and Balance of soil heavy metals (Cd, Cu & Zn). Miterra can also model a suite of mitigation measures, and can be used to assess the effects of different management strategies and policies at farm, national, or European level. The Miterra model comprises a comprehensive, collated input database on European climate and soil data, livestock numbers, land use, crop areas and yields, nutrient inputs and outputs, and emission factors for greenhouse gas emissions, and runoff and leaching factors for N. The model calculations are primarily based on emission factors, but also include processed-based algorithms from other models such as INTEGRATOR, RothC, and ALFAM2. The Miterra model can be roughly divided into 2 main components ( Figure 1.1): one capturing the flows in and emissions from the livestock sector, and the other representing the processes in the soil and the cropping sector. In the livestock sector, N content in livestock excretions in both solid and liquid forms during housing, farmyard, storage, and grazing periods are calculated. Gaseous N emissions, including NH3, N2O, and NOx, as well as N losses to water during storage, are estimated using emission factors. Ex-storage manure and excretions during grazing are distributed to the soil as organic fertilisers. Other nutrient inputs to soil include minerla fertilisers, crop residues, atmospheric depositions, and biological N fixation. In the soil, the uptake of nutrient elements by crop, emissions to the atmosphere, runoff and leaching to surface water and groundwater, and the turnover of soil organic matters are calculated by the model to produce a detailed budget of nutrient input, output, and balance. Figure 1.1: Shematic illustration of the Miterra model showing the flow direction of nutrient elements. Miterra was originally developed to focus on the flows of C, N, and P. Recent development has included processes to model other elements, such as S, K, Na, Ca, and Mg, as well as heavy metals Cd, Cu, and Zn. The flows of most elements are modelled independent of each other, except for the turnover of organic C and N, which are coupled via C:N ratios.","title":"1.

Emissions of NH3-N, N2O-N, NOx-N, N2-N, and NO3–-N losses to water are calculated for manure storage. In the first step, the amounts of total N and TAN that are passed to storage system are calculated. It is assumed that all yard manure (both solid and liquid forms) are collected into the slurry storage system. This step simplifies the method in EMEP Guidebook by assuming that all manure are stored before application. Manures applied to fields directly from livestock housing, and manures (mainly slurries) used as feedstocks for digestion, are not considered due to lack of reliable estimation.

Soil N surplus is the difference between soil N addition and crop N removal at field level. Soil N surplus is an indicator for the potential of N losses to the environment. Equation 10.6 Corrected soil N surplus is the difference between soil N addition and soil N losses, including gaseous emissions, surface runoff, and crop removal, at field level. Corrected soil N surplus reflects the potential for N leaching and denitrification. Equation 10.7 The Miterra models assume that there is no change in the soil mineral N pool, and that all N applied to the soil which is not lost at soil surface, nor taken up by the crop, are either leached below root zone, or lost to the atmosphere via denitirfication. N leaching may be determined in two parallel approaches: Method 1: Coventional Miterra Approach Leaching is a fraction of the corrected soil total N surplus (i.e., the organic and mineral N fractions are lumped) as described in Equation 10.7. Method 2: The RothCN Approach The RothCN model calculates changes in soil mineral N pool as the balance of mineralization and immobolization during soil organic matter decomposition. Leaching is then estimated as a fraction of corrected soil mineral N surplus (See Emissions and balances). Equation 10.8 where: is the fraction of precipitation surplus leached below the root zone, which is calculated in Leaching. Due to the nature of approximate estimation in Miterra, the calculated Nsurplus, corrected may be < 0. In that case, Nsurplus_corrected, leaching, and denitrification should all be set to 0 to avoid negative values. The N that has leached below root zones are further partitioned to leaching to groundwater, and interflow that end up in large surface waters, which are determined by a ground flow fraction ( ). The ground flow fraction is a region-specific coefficient based on the modelling by Keuskamp et al. (2012). Equation 10.9 The part of N(surplus, corrected) that is not leached, is denitrified.

The soil P pool is divided into: An inert P pool with no change over time, A stable P pool, S, changing slowly according to a rate limited reaction with dissolved P in the soil solution, and A labile P pool, L, changing rapidly according to an equilibrium reaction with dissolved P in soil solution. The sum of the labile and stable pool is assumed to be approximated by oxalate extractable P (Pox), further denoted as the reactive P pool. The initial size of Pox must be provided by user. The labile pool, L, is at the start assumed to be 1/3 of Pox, and the stable pool, S, thus being equal to 2/3 of Pox. The maximum size of Pox is assumed to be 1/2 of (Al + Fe)ox, with (Al + Fe)ox being the oxalate extractable Al and Fe contents (mmol kg–1). Equation 11.1 The concentration of inorganic P in soil solution, [Pi], is calculated from the size of the labile P pool (L) according to a Langmuir equation: Equation 11.2 where: is the size of the adsorbed labile P pool (mmol kg–1). is the theoretical maximum adsorption (mmol kg–1), which is 1/6 of . is a Langmuir adsorption constant (m3 kg–1). Soil Texture Peat Sand Loam Clay Soil Texture Class 1 2 3 500 1000 1500 2000 is the inorganic P concentration (g m–3, or mg L–1). The value of 1000 is used to convert result from kg m–3 to g m–3 (mg L–1). The size of L is bounded by Lmin and Lmax. [Pi] is bounded to [0.001, 90]. If any calculated value falls outside the boundaries, the value must be clipped. See Minimum and maximum pool sizes for further explanation. The total (both inorganic and organic) P concentration, Pt, is then derived using an exponential relationship between total P and inorganic P based on measurements in soil solution, drainage water and surface water, as reported by Chardon et al. (2007) (in Dutch): Equation 11.3 where: is the total P concentration (g m–3, or mg L–1). is the inorganic P concentration (g m–3, or mg L–1). The transfer between P in the soil solution and the stable pool, Ptrans, is described by a rate-limited Freundlich equation: Equation 11.4 where: is the rate constant (day–1) for the transfer from soil solution to the stable pool, with a default value of 0.0014. is the rate constant (day–1) for the transfer from the stable pool to soil solution, with a default value of 2 × 10–6 for sand, and 44 × 10–6 for clay and peat soils. is the Freundlich constant of the stable pool (mmol kg–1 (mg L–1)–n). is the inorganic P concentration (g m–3, or mg L–1). is the exponent of stable pool, with a default value of 0.26. is the size of the stable pool (mmol kg–1). The value of Ptrans can be positive or negative: dissolved P transfers to S. S transfers to dissolved P. P surplus is simply calculated as the difference between P input and crop P uptake: Equation 11.5 where: is the annual P deposition (kg P ha–1 yr–1). is the annual P input from mineral fertilisers (kg P ha–1 yr–1). is the annual P input from animal manure (kg P ha–1 yr–1). is the annual P removed from soil by crop uptake (kg P ha–1 yr–1). P runoff and leaching are calculated based on the total P concentration and the waterflux: Equation 11.6 where: is the total P concentration (g m–3, or mg L–1). is the daily interflow (subsurface runoff) (m3 ha–1 day–1). is the daily leaching effluent to shallow groundwater (m3 ha–1 day–1). For calculations of Qint and Qeff, refer to 5. Water Fluxes. P accumulation (Pacc) is calculated as: Equation 11.7 where: the P surplus (g ha–1 day–1). is the loss of P by leaching and runoff (g ha–1 day–1). The changes in the labile and stable pools are calculated on a daily basis. The change in the labile P pool is calculated by a mass balance: Equation 11.8 where: are the size of the labile P pool (mmol kg–1) at time t + 1 and time t, respectively. is the P accumulation (g ha–1 day–1). is the transfer flux from the soil solution to the stable pool of adsorbed P (mmol kg–1 day–1). is the length of the time step (1 day). To convert the unit of and from g ha–1 day–1 to mmol kg–1 day–1: where: is the thickness of the soil layer (cm). the bulk density of the soil (g cm–3). is the molar mass of P (31 g mol–1) . The change in the stable P pool is calculated as: Equation 11.9 where: are the size of the stable P pool (mmol kg–1) at time t + 1 and time t, respectively. is the transfer flux from the soil solution to the stable pool of adsorbed P (mmol kg–1 day–1). is the length of the time step (1 day). The change in the reactive P pool, Pox, can be determined as: Equation 11.10 From Equation 11.2 it can be deduced that when L approaches L'max, [Pi] can become infinitely high. To maintain [Pi] in a reasonable range, we set for [Pi] a minimum value of 0.001 mg L–1, and a maximum value of 90 mg L–1. The minimum and maximum boundaries Lmin and Lmax may be determined as: Equation 11.11 The upper boundary of S pool is equal to Smax, which is defined as: Equation 11.12 The calculated size of L and S in each time step is checked so that they do not exceed the boundaries: Equation 11.13 Following Equation 11.13, in the case of Lt > Lmax or St > Smax, Lt and St are clipped to their respective maximums. The excess P (Lt − Lmax or St − Smax) must go to a provisional buffer pool B, which acts as a precipitation pool to temporarily store these excess P. The buffer pool also have precedence over L and S in P mining. When B > 0, any transfer of adsporped P to soil solution will first come from B, and any remainder will then come from L and S. The following pseudocode in Python demonstrates how the buffer pool is used. The dynamics of S is calculated before the dynamics of L. P_trans = ... # Transfer flow between dissolved P and adsorped stable P pool. B = ... # Buffer precipitation pool. dB = ... # Change in the B pool. S = ... # Adsorped stable P pool.

B is used before S. 2 B is smaller than Ptrans, B is depleted, and Ptrans is offset by B. 3 B is larger than Ptrans, Ptrans is set to 0 since no P will be coming from S, and B is reduced by Ptrans. 4 Transfer from dissolved P to adsorped stable pool. B acts as a buffer pool for excess P. 5 No excess P. B remains unchanged. 6 Excess P goes into B. No need to adjust the sizes of Ptrans or S, since S + Ptrans will be clipped to Smax. 7 Update the sizes of B and S. P_acc = ... # P accumulation. P_trans = ... # Transfer flow between dissolved P and adsorped stable P pool. B = ... # Buffer precipitation pool. dB = ... # Change in the B pool. L = ... # Adsorped labile P pool.

Note that in this case a small amount of P ( |L' − Lmin| - B ) will appear to be coming out of nowhere. However, since this value will be very small, it may be safely negelected. 8 B is larger than the difference, B is reduced by the amount of the difference. 9 When L' > Lmax, B acts as a buffer pool for excess P. 10 When Lmin < L' < Lmax, B remains unchanged. 11 Update the sizes of B and L.","title":"11.

Calculations of organic C and N inputs from crop residues are described in Residue removal & incorporation. For N input, it is assumed that all N in crop residues are in organic form. Organic C inputs from manure application and grazing excretion are calculated based on the N content and C:N ratios: Equation 15.B.1 where: is the total N in applied manure or grazing excretion (kg N ha–1). is the C:N ratio of manure or grazing excretion. N in manure is present in both inorganic and organic forms. Equation 15.B.2 where: is the total N in applied manure or grazing excretion (kg N ha–1). is the fraction of organic N in total N. Calculation of C and N (both inorganic and organic forms) content in compost and sludge is decribed in 8. Compost & Sludge. Other sources of mineral N input include: Atmospheric deposition Biological N fixation (BNF) The estimation of BNF for each type of crop is given in Biological N fixation. Only BNF by arable crops (including perennial crops) and grassland are counted as direct mineral N input. N-fixing microorganisms often form symbiosis with legume crops, and it is therefore assumed that BNF by soybeans and pulses are immediately taken up by those crops, and are returned to soil via residue incorporation. After integration of RothCN into Miterra, the soil N pool is now separated into organic and mineral pools. Nitrogen inputs are partitioned into soil mineral or organic N pools according to their respective fractions of mineal and organic N content. The organic and mineral N pools are connected via mineralization or immobilization during soil organic matter descmposition. Soil mineral N pool is the only source for crop N uptake, N emissions, and losses. Figure 15.B.1: Integration of RothCN with Miterra. Surface losses include gaseous emissions (NH3, N2O, and NOx) and surface runoff, originating from fertiliser applications and grazing excretions. Calculations of these losses are based on total N content (both organic and mineral), and are described in 10. N Losses from Soil. Crop removal refers to the part of N removed from the field by harvest and residue removal. Calculations are described in Harvested products and Residue removal & incorporation. In the original approach of Miterra, leaching is calculated as a fraction of soil total N surplus. With RothCN integration, leaching is now calculated as a fraction of corrected mineral N surplus in soil. Equation 15.B.3 where: is the annual total gaseous emissions of NH3, NOx, and N2O from fertilization, grazing excretions, and residues (see 10. N Losses from Soil). is the annual N losses from fertilization and grazing excretions via surface runoff (see Surface runoff). is the annual N removed from the field by harvest and residue removal (see Harvested products and Residue removal & incorporation). is the fraction of water flow that is leached (see Leaching). Should N losses from soil mineral N pool be subtracted monthly, or annually? Annually at the end of the year. In Miterra, crop uptake, emissions, runoff, and leaching are all calculated as annual losses, and distributed evenly to 12 months over the year. Annual N inputs are divided as mineral and organic fractions, and distributed to monthly inputs in the same way. Due to lack of data and reliable estimation on soil mineral N content, RothCN assumed that soil mineral N pool at the beginning of the year to be 0. In the first month of the simulation, the size of soil mineral N pool is only equal to the size of monthly mineral N input, plus the N mineralized from SOM decomposition in the first month. This value is very likely less than the estimated monthly losses. In this case, if losses are subtracted monthly, it will lead to a negative soil mineral N pool size. While the pool size may be reset to 0, the same problem will occur in the next month, and likely propagete to the rest of the year. In the end, this will lead to an underestimated N leaching, as the monthly soil mineral N surpluses for some months are 0. This is avoided by calculating balances annually at the end of the year. Without substracting losses in each month, the soil mineral N pool accumulates inputs and mineralized N towards the end of thhe year. In this way, by the end of the year, the soil mineral N pool size reflects the annual mineral N input, and the annual potential net mineralization, which is more in line with the estimated annual losses. Should surface losses be subtracted from input before addition, or from soil mineral N pool after decomposition? From soil mineral N pool after decomposition. N losses from soil surface, including gaseous emissions and surface runoff, are estimated in Miterra as total N. If these losses are subtracted from the input before addition, the following equations apply: An unintended implicit assumption is made in this case: that in N losses, the fraction of fmineral comes from existing mineral N at the time of addition, and the fraction of forganic is attributed to be originating from organic N in the input material. However, this implicit assumption is not reliable. To consider this matter from a mechanistic, process-based perspective: all organic N forms must be mineralized to inorganic N before they can be utilized by plants, or converted to gaseous emissions. However, determination of mineralization fraction before addition is not possible. Therefore, it is justifiable to substract N loss terms after calculation of SOM decomposition. The following pseudocode in Python gives an example of the implementation of the RothCN model. The pseudocode focuses on the logical sequence of model calculations rather than actual formulae.

It uses the same algorithms as RothC to estimate SOC turnover, and extends the calculation to include SON turnover by introducing C:N ratios to each SOM compartment. During decomposition of SOC compartments, N is released from the decomposing materials, and in the meantime is also assimilated into microbial biomass and humus according to their respective C:N ratios. The difference between N release and assimilation determines whether net mineralization or immobilization takes place. The RothCN model distinguishes organic inputs between plant residues and manure, as the two input types have distinct C:N ratios. Each organic input material is further divided into an easily decomposable and a resistant fraction, depending on their decomposability. Therefore, RothCN maintains four distinct SOM compartments for input materials: DPM & RPM for plant residues, and DMA & RMA for manure. Additionally for manure, a small fraction is assigned for already humified material (HMA). HMA immediately becomes part of HUM once added to soil, therefore it is only considered when partitioning the input material, but not maintained as a separate SOM compartment. Plant residues (DPM & RPM), manure (DMA & RMA), together with microbial biomass (BIO) and humus (HUM), form the decomposable SOM compartments. In each time step, a fraction of each decomposable compartment decomposes following a first-order reaction kinetics, and converts into BIO, HUM, and CO2. The inert organic matter compartment (IOM) is immune from decomposition.

Rate modifying factors are calculated following standard RothC approach. The rate modifying factor for temperature is given by: Equation 15.A.1 in which T is the monthly average temperature (°C). First, the maximum topsoil moisture deficit (TSMDmax) is calculated: Equation 15.A.2 where: is the percentage of clay content in the soil (5% is 5, not 0.05). is the depth of the soil layer (cm). Next, the accumulative TSMD (TSMDacc) is calculated. At the beginning of the simulation, TSMDacc is set to 0. Then, in each of the following month: Equation 15.A.3 And the moisture factor is given by: Equation 15.A.4 The soil cover factor slows decomposition if growing plants are present. Equation 15.A.5 The final modifying factor is calculated by multiplying all factors: Equation 15.A.6 In many calculation cases of the RothCN model, a certain amount of N must be partitioned into several compartments according to the respective C:N ratio of each compartment. As a consequence, the sum of N from relevant compartments estimated using C:N ratios may not match the amount of the available N for partitioning. Here we describe a generic algorithm to partition a fixed amount of N into any number of compartments, while keeping the relative size of each compartment. The amount of Ntotal is partitioned into n compartments according to the C size (Ci=1…n) and theoretical C:N ratio (r'i=1…n) of each compartment: Equation 15.A.7 If , the provisional size of N compartments (N'i) must be scaled while keeping their relative proportions, i.e., for any compartments i and j: Equation 15.A.8 , and satisfies that . For any compartment x, solve Nx and rx: Equation 15.A.9 Derivation At the beginning of the simulation period, the initial soil organic carbon pool (SOCinit) is primed based on soil properties: Equation 15.A.10 where: is the bulk density of the soil (g cm–3). is the depth of the soil layer (cm). is the percentage of soil organic carbon content (5% is 5, not 0.05). If soil organic matter content (SOM%) is provided, it may be multiplied by 0.5 to give SOC%. For compartments DPM, RPM, DMA, and RMA, their respective initial size (Cinit) is calculated assuming a steady state as follows. In the special case where a field has never received organic fertilisers (manure), the initial sizes of CDMA and CRMA should be set to 0. Equation 15.A.11 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA}. is the average size of annual carbon input during the simulation period (kg C ha–1 yr–1). is the average rate modifying factor ( Equation 15.A.6) over the simulation period. is the first-order decomposition rate constant of the compartment. If crop history is available, and should be replaced with corresponding data of the years before the simulation period for better estimation. Explanation The steady state assumes that the C input during a time step is decomposed within the same time step, i.e., the stock remains unchanged. According to first-order reaction kinetics: Since and , The initial size of IOM is estimated according to Falloon et al. (1998). IOM is excluded from SOM decomposition, therefore its size remains the same throughout the simulation. Equation 15.A.12 In the original equation, SOC is in tonne C ha–1. Therefore, SOCinit must be converted to tonne C ha–1, and then the result is converted back to kg C ha–1. After the initial sizes of input materials and IOM pools are determined, the initial sizes of the BIO and HUM pools can be calculated as: Equation 15.A.13 in which is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, IOM}. , are the first-order decomposition rate constants of the BIO and HUM pool, respectively. For all SOM compartments, the initial sizes of organic N are calculated as: Equation 15.A.14 in which is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM, IOM}. is the theoretical C:N ratio of the i-th compartment. If the overall soil C:N ratio is given, an extra step of mass balance check is performed, so that the sum of SON from all compartments matches the size determined from the soil C:N ratio, i.e.: Equation 15.A.15 in which is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM, IOM}. If the mass balance check fails, SON sizes in the soil compartments must be adjusted according to Equation 15.A.9. The initial size of soil mineral and organic N pools are finally determined as: Equation 15.A.16 If measurement or estimation on soil mineral N content is available, soil mineral N pool should be primed with the measured or estimated value. When an organic input material such as plant residues or manure is added, the organic carbon in the input material is partitioned into relevant compartments according to their respective fractions. Equation 15.A.17 where: is the respective compartment, _i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, HMA}. is the total organic carbon content in the plant residues or manure input (kg C ha–1). is the fraction of individual compartment in the input material (see Table 15.A.1). The size of organic nitrogen partitioned into each compartment is provisionally determined by the size of organic C and the theoretical C:N ratio. Equation 15.A.18 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, HMA}. is the theoretical C:N ratio for each compartment (see Table 15.A.1). Then, Equation 15.A.9 is used to ensure that the sum of partitioned N matches the actual N content in the input materials. This balance check is performed separately for plant residues and manure: Equation 15.A.19 Decomposition of an organic carbon compartment is simulated on a monthly time step. The size of the compartment at the beginning of the month is equal to the size at the end of the previous month, plus any additional input. The following convention to denote a time interval is used throughout all sections: Subscript t0 denotes the starting point of the interval, Subscript t denotes the end point of the interval, Subscript t – 1 denotes the end point of the previous time interval. Equation 15.A.20 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, HUM}. is the monthly organic C input (kg C ha–1). Note that HMA from manure input is added into HUM. The decomposition follows a first order reaction kinetics. The size of the compartment at the end of the month is given by: Equation 15.A.21 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}; is the combined rate modifying factor ( Equation 15.A.6), is the yearly 1st order decomposition rate constant (yr–1). is 1/12, since k is a yearly decomposition rate. Therefore, the amount of decomposed C is: Equation 15.A.22 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. The symbol δ denotes decomposed material. Decomposed organic carbon from all compartments is summed up to give the overall SOC decomposition: Equation 15.A.23 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. A fraction of δSOC is lost as CO2, and the rest remains in the soil (Cremain), and is assimilated by microorganisms (BIO) or converted to humus (HUM). The ratio of δSOC lost as CO2 to those remained in soil (μ) is determined by the clay content of the soil: Equation 15.A.24 where: is a scaling factor with a default value of 1.67 for Rothamsted soils (23.4% clay). is the percent clay content in the soil (i.e., 23.4% is 23.4, not 0.234). Therefore, the fraction of CO2 emission is , and the fraction of remains in the soil and is assimilated into BIO and HUM compartments by a ratio of 0.46 and 0.54, respectively. Equation 15.A.25 Monthly mineral N input is added to soil mineral N pool at the beginning of the month. Equation 15.A.26 where: is the monthly mineral N input (kg N ha–1). Monthly organic N input is added to the relevant compartments at the beginning of the month. Equation 15.A.27 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, HUM}. is the monthly organic N input to the i-th compartment (kg N ha–1). Note that HMA from manure input is added into HUM. Soil organic N pool is also updated with monthly additions: Equation 15.A.28 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, HUM}. After input addition, the actual C:N ratio of each compartment is determined: Equation 15.A.29 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. If the field has never received manure input (i.e. DMA and RMA = 0), this could lead to a division-by-zero error. Set r values of the corresponding compartments to NaN to avoid it. After the determination of decomposed organic C in each compartment, N released during decomposition is calculated: Equation 15.A.30 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. The size of the N pool at the end of the month (Nt) is determined by: Equation 15.A.31 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. The total N released from decomposition is: Equation 15.A.32 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. δSON is further assimilated by BIO and HUM. The potential amount assimilated into each compartment is calculated as: Equation 15.A.33 where: is the respective compartment, BIO or HUM. is the potential amount of decomposed SOC assimilated by the BIO or HUM compartment ( Equation 15.A.25). are the theoretical (see Table 15.A.1) and actual C:N ratios ( Equation 15.A.29) of the compartment, respectively. The lesser of the two values is used to maximize N assimilation. The apostrophe in N'assim denotes that its value is provisional and may subject to further adjustment (see Immobilization). The difference between total N released from decomposition, and the N requirement for assimilation, is calculated: Equation 15.A.34 If Ndiff > 0, then net mineralization takes place. Ndiff is added to soil mineral N pool as inorganic N, and the corresponding amount is subtracted from soil organic N pool. Equation 15.A.35 If Ndiff < 0, immobilization must take place to satisfy the N requirement by BIO and HUM assimilation. As soil microorganisms must compete with plants for N, immobilization is not able to utilize the entire soil mineral N pool. A coefficient (an arbitrary parameter for calibration, with a default value of 0.8) is applied to derive the mineral N available for immobilization. Equation 15.A.36 If Nimmobilizable ≥ |Ndiff|, all N requirement for immobilization can be fulfilled. The amount of |Ndiff| is deducted from soil mineral N and added to organic N pool. Equation 15.A.37 where: is the potential N assimilation calculated by Equation 15.A.33. If Nimmobilizable < |Ndiff|, there is no sufficient N for full immobilization. One of two methods may be used to implement immobilization in this case: either N assimilation is partially fulfilled (“partial fulfillment”), or organic matter decomposition is reduced (“deferred decomposition”). The total immobilized N (Nimmob) can be determined as: Equation 15.A.38 The size of soil mineral and organic N pool after immobilization is: Equation 15.A.39 Method 1: Partial fulfillment Method 2: Deferred decomposition This is the current method implemented in Miterra-Europe. In this approach, the BIO and HUM compartments will disregard their C:N ratios, and assimilate all immobilizable N. This leads to changes in C:N ratios of the BIO and HUM compartments. The BIO compartment has priority for N assimilation over HUM. Therefore, Nimmob satisfies assimilation by BIO first, and any remaining part goes into HUM. Equation 15.A.40 If : If : where: is the potential N assimilation calculated by Equation 15.A.33. This approach is currently not implemented. The description given here is so far for reference only. In this approach, decomposition of organic matter in each soil compartment is reduced. As it is difficult to estimate new decomposition rate constant for each compartment, we opt for a “deferred decomposition” approach. The decomposition rate constants remain unchanged, instead a fraction of the source material is withheld from decomposition in the current time step, and is “deferred” for decomposition until a later iteration, as soon as there is sufficient inorganic N. The actual N assimilated into BIO and HUM compartments are calculated as: Equation 15.A.41 where: is the respective compartment, BIO or HUM, and is the potential N assimilation calculated by Equation 15.A.33. The actual C assimilated into BIO and HUM compartments can be determined from C:N ratios, following the rearranged form of Equation 15.A.33: Equation 15.A.42 The actual amount of decomposed SOC can be determined using an inversed form of Equation 15.A.25: Equation 15.A.43 The amount of deferred SOC is then calculated as: Equation 15.A.44 The deferred SOC is partitioned into each compartment as follows: Equation 15.A.45 where: is the respective compartment, i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}. Following deferred decomposition, all subsequent C and N calculations from Equation 15.A.23 onwards must be rerun to produce new values. With this approach, and should be able to converge in one iteration. Finally, the deferred C is added to the respective compartment as input in the next time step. Equation 15.A.46 At the end of the year, all forms of N removal from soil within the year, including gaseous emissions, surface runoff, leaching, and crop removal, are subtracted from soil minerl N pool. Any remaining soil mineral N is assumed to be completely denitrified. Equation 15.A.47 The annual changes in soil organic C and N pools can be determined as: Equation 15.A.48 where: is the respective compartment,i ∈ {DPM, RPM, DMA, RMA, BIO, HUM}.","title":"15.A.

ESDB Depth Class Rooting Depth Class froot (4) Obstacle to roots between 20–40 cm depth Shallow 1.0 (3) Obstacle to roots between 40–60 cm depth Moderate 1.0 (2) Obstacle to roots between 60–80 cm depth Deep 0.75 (1) No obstacle to roots between 0–80 cm Very Deep 0.75 is a reduction factor for soil organic carbon content. SOC data are based on ESDB “Topsoil organic carbon content” (database field OC_TOP). ESDB SOC Class fsoc (H) High (> 6%) 0.5 (M) Medium (2–6%) 0.75 (L) Low (1-2%) 0.9 (V) Very low (< 1%) 1.0 For a heterogeneous region, reduction factors are calculated as area-weighed averages ( Equation 5.2).","title":"5.
